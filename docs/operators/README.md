## What are Operators?

From RedHat's own website:
"An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes-native application. A Kubernetes-native application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling."

What does that mean?
If the software you are intersted is using has an operator, that operator is something you can use to install that software in your cluster.

## Operator Framework

"The Operator Framework is an open source project that provides developers and cluster administrators tooling to accelerate development and deployment of an Operator."
